A vehicle detection system is a technology that automatically identifies the presence of vehicles in a
particular area or environment. This system is commonly used in traffic management, parking facilities, and
security surveillance.
Vehicle detection systems are designed to improve safety, increase efficiency, and provide real-time
information to operators. They can help detect traffic congestion, accidents, and other incidents that can lead
to delays or safety hazards. They can also help optimize parking lot usage by providing information about
available parking spaces.
There are several types of vehicle detection systems, including those based on sensors, cameras, and
machine learning algorithms. These systems use various methods to identify and track vehicles, including
radar, magnetic sensors, infrared sensors, and license plate recognition.
Vehicle detection systems are essential for modern infrastructure, as they help to improve safety, efficiency,
and sustainability in transportation and parking management.
